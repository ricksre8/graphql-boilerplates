## Features

- Simple data model, easy to adjust
- Database with powerful CRUD API (powered by [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/))
- Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config)
- Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground) & [Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)

## Getting started

#### Requirements

* Node 8 (or higher)
* Graphcool CLI (Get it via `npm i -g graphcool@beta`)
* GraphQL CLI (Get it via `npm i -g graphql-cli@beta`)
* Optional: GraphQL Playground desktop app (Download [here](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground/releases))

#### 1. Setting up your project

##### Option A: Via `graphql create` (recommended)

```sh
# 1 .From your root directory of choice execute
graphql create my-app

# 2. When prompted, choose the `node-basic` option

# 3. Navigate to the new project
cd my-app

#4. Deploy the Graphcool database
graphcool deploy
```

##### Option B: By cloning repo

```sh
# 1. Clone the repo and navigate into project directory
git clone https://github.com/graphql-boilerplates/node-graphql-server.git
cd node-graphql-server/basic

# 2. Deploy the Graphcool database
graphcool deploy

# 3. Install node dependencies
yarn install
```

#### 2. Start the local server

```sh
# Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000)
yarn start

# Open Playground to explore GraphQL API
yarn playground
```

## Docs

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground
* `yarn deploy` deploys GraphQL server to [`now`](https://now.sh)

### Project overview

#### `/` (_root directory_)

- [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-boilerplate/blob/master/.graphqlconfig.yml) GraphQL Config file containing the endpoints and schema configuration. Used by the [`graphql-cli`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-cli) and the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground). See [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config) for more information.
- [`graphcool.yml`](./graphcool.yml): The root configuration file for your database service ([documentation](https://www.graph.cool/docs/1.0/reference/graphcool.yml/overview-and-example-foatho8aip)).

#### `/database`

- [`database/datamodel.graphql`](./database/datamodel.graphql) contains the data model that you define for the project (written in [SDL](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51)).
- [`database/schema.generated.graphql`](./database/schema.generated.graphql) defines the **database schema**. It contains the definition of the CRUD API for the types in your data model and is generated based on your `datamodel.graphql`. **You should never edit this file manually**, but introduce changes only by altering `datamodel.graphql` and run `graphcool deploy`.

#### `/src`

- [`src/schema.graphql`](src/schema.graphql) defines your **application schema**. It contains the GraphQL API that you want to expose to your client applications.
- [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) is the entry point of your server, pulling everything together and starting the `GraphQLServer` from [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga).

### Common Questions

#### I'm getting a 'Schema could not be fetched.' error after deploying, what gives?

Access to the Graphcool API is secured by a secret. This also applies to the introspection query. Using the latest version of GraphQL Playground, the `Authorization` header should automatically be setup with a proper JWT signing the secret. If that's not the case, you can follow these steps to access your API:

1. Visit http://jwtbuilder.jamiekurtz.com/
1. Replace the `Key` at the bottom of the page with [your secret from the `.env` file](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-boilerplate/blob/master/.env#L3)
1. Click `Create signed JWT` and copy the obtained token
1. Now, to access the schema, use the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, or in the GraphQL Playground set it as JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <token>"
  }
  ```
1. Reload the schema in the Playground (the _refresh_-button is located right next to the URL of the server)

> Note: Currently, no content of the signed JWT is verified. This will be implemented [according to this proposal](https://github.com/graphcool/framework/issues/1365) at a later stage.
