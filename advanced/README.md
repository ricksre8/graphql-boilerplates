## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL Server:** `graphql-yoga` based on Apollo Server & Express
- **GraphQL-native database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to Prisma (running on MySQL)
- Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [Tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- Simple data model â€“ easy to adjust
- Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup
- Authentication based on email & password
- Realtime functionality with GraphQL subscriptions (_coming soon_)

## Requirements

You need to have the following things installed:

* Node 8+
* GraphQL CLI: `npm i -g graphql-cli`
* GraphQL Playground desktop app (optional): [Download](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground/releases)

## Getting started

```sh
# 1. Bootstrap GraphQL server in directory `my-app`, based on `node-advanced` boilerplate
graphql create my-app --boilerplate node-advanced

# 2. When prompted, choose the Prisma cluster you want to deploy to
# e.g. prisma-eu1 or prisma-us1 to deploy to a public cluster (recommended)
# or locally (requires Docker)

# 3. Navigate to the new project
cd my-app

# 4. Start server (runs on http://localhost:4000)
yarn start

# 5. Open Playground to explore GraphQL API
yarn playground
```

## Docs

### Commands

* `yarn start` starts GraphQL server
* `yarn debug` starts GraphQL server in debug mode (open [chrome://inspect/#devices](chrome://inspect/#devices) to debug)
* `yarn playground` opens the GraphQL Playground
* `yarn prisma` access to local version of the Prisma CLI

### Project structure

#### `/` - configuration files

- [`.env`](./.env) Contains important environment variables for development. Read about how it works [here](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
- [`.graphqlconfig.yml`](./.graphqlconfig.yml) GraphQL configuration file containing the endpoints and schema configuration. Used by the [`graphql-cli`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-cli) and the [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground). See [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) for more information.

#### `/database` - Prisma service

- [`database/prisma.yml`](./database/prisma.yml) The configuration file for your database service ([documentation](https://www.prismagraphql.com/docs/reference/prisma.yml/overview-and-example-foatho8aip)).
- [`database/datamodel.graphql`](./database/datamodel.graphql) contains the data model that you define for your database service (written in [SDL](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-sdl-schema-definition-language-6755bcb9ce51)).

#### `/src` - application server

- [`src/schema.graphql`](src/schema.graphql) defines your **application schema**. It contains the GraphQL API that you want to expose to your client applications.
- [`src/index.js`](src/index.js) is the entry point of your server, putting everything together and starting the `GraphQLServer` from [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga).
- [`src/resolvers/`](src/resolvers) contains the actual business logic of your application. In GraphQL, you implement [resolver functions](http://graphql.org/learn/execution/) that *resolve* a specific query being requested.
- [`src/generated/prisma.graphql`](src/generated/prisma.graphql) defines the **database schema**. It contains the GraphQL API exposed by the Prisma Database. This file is automatically generated every time `yarn prisma deploy` is executed, according to the datamodel in `database/datamodel.graphql`.
