<div align="center"><strong>Bootstrap your GraphQL server within seconds</strong></div>
<div align="center">GraphQL boilerplates provide the perfect foundation for your GraphQL server, no matter if you're just getting started with GraphQL or aim to build a fully-fledged application.</div>

<br />

## Features

- **Rapid scaffolding**: Simply use `graphql create` (from the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli)) to download the boilerplate you want.
- **Easily extensible**: A boilerplate only provides the minimum setup so you can tailor the API to your use case.
- **Best practices**: Each boilerplate incorporates best practices from the GraphQL community.

## Quickstart

Select a boilerplate and follow the instructions in the belonging README to get started:

- `minimal` (_coming soon_): Minimal boilerplate with basic "Hello World" functionality
- [`basic`](./basic): Basic boilerplate based on a simple data model and with a GraphQL database
- [`advanced`](./advanced): Advanced boilerplate with a GraphQL database, authentication and realtime subscriptions

All projects are based on [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/), a fully-featured GraphQL server library with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience.

## Contributing

The GraphQL boilerplates are maintained by the GraphQL community, with official support from the [Apollo](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com) & [Graphcool](https://blog.graph.cool/) teams.
