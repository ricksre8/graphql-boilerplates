Starter projects for GraphQL servers. This repository contains boilerplates for three different scenarios:

- minimal (_coming soon_): Minimal boilerplate with basic "Hello World" functionality
- [`basic`](./basic): Basic boilerplate based on a simple data model and with a GraphQL database
- [`advanced`](./advanced): Advanced boilerplate with a GraphQL database authentication and realtime subscriptions

All projects are based on [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga/), a fully-featured GraphQL server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience.
